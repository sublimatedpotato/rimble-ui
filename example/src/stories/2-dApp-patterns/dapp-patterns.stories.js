        Well-designed transaction states will build trust and confidence in your
        dApp by helping users understand what's going on and setting their
        expectations.
      </Heading.h2>
      <Text.p>
        Transaction states are such a crucial part of dApp UX because they're so
        different to what we're used to when transacting with centralized products. While ridding the process of a
        "middleperson" might have given us more personal autonomy, it has left
        us with less immediacy and more complexity to design for. This means providing feedback to reassure or guide users is more important than ever.

      <Text.p>
        Ethereum transactions aren't quick by centralized standards. So for
        inexperienced dApp users, transaction speeds may produce anxiety around
        whether something has worked or not. Use messaging in your states to
        explain that parts of the process may take a while.{' '}

      <Heading.h4>Gas</Heading.h4>
      <Text.p>
        All blockchain actions require "Gas" or a "transaction fee". Users are
        not used to paying for actions in digital products. Make sure you
        introduce this concept in a timely manner. If you leave it until the
        user is in the process of confirming the transaction in their Ethereum
        account, this makes it feel like a hidden fee and is likely to cause
        uneasiness.

      <Text.p>
        Ethereum transactions are complicated. Explaining everything under the
        hood isn't necessary, but you should stll make sure your user is aware
        of big changes in the transaction cycle.
      </Text.p>
      <Text>
        <b>1.</b> Confirm that the button they pressed to initiate the
        transaction worked. Be sure to point them to their wallet if they need
        to confirm the transaction there.

        <b>3.</b> If your users are more experienced in blockchain, you may want
        to signal when you can confirm the transaction has been taken on by a
        miner. Note: this could cause confusion for new and inexperienced users,
        so consider skipping until the transaction has been a success or
        failure.{' '}

        <b>4.</b> Let users know once the thing they set out to do by pressing
        the button has happened. In the case of our demo, it was that the value

        <b>5.</b> Let the user know if something has gone wrong and the
        transaction can't be completed. Include why the transaction failed and
        how to remedy the situation (if possible). Consider other UI for this
        state as it may require action from the user.

      <ToastMessage.Failure

      <Text.p>
        Our demo uses toast messages as the transaction speed is pretty quick,
        but they disappear automatically. So use other parts of the interface to
        provide updates on the process. Your users may not just watch their
        screen after submitting a transation.

        Use specific language throughout. If the
        transaction is actually transfering a crypto asset, refer to that. Or if
        your users are casting a vote on the blockchain, reference the vote.
        This will spare users having to make connections in their head. Echo the
        language you'd use in the button to initiate the transaction e.g. Send
        Cryptokitty or Cast vote.

        Your dApp can detect a network as long as there's a web 3 provider. And
        once the user has connected their Ethereum address with your dApp you
        can read the account balance. Don't wait until a transaction to tell
        your user about an incorrect network or a 0 ETH balance. This is not
